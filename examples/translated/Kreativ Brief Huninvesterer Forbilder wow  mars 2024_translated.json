The capital gap is still a reality.\nLatest measurements in the population show that approx. half now save in funds. The increase in new female fund customers in DNB since #huninvesterer was launched (compared to the period before) is a whopping 288%.\nFunds have become a common form of savings, but the financial inequalities are still great, and men still save a larger amount than women per month.\nThe vast majority save (women in brackets) - only 5% (4%) answer that they do not, 76% (83%) save in a savings account, 52% (50%) in mutual funds, 47% (47%) in a bank account, 22% (14%) in individual shares.\nThe latest concept, which was launched in early October 2023, used the insights we have compiled, where we see, among other things, that women are more motivated by other female role models - than by male ones.
